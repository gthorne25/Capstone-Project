We are planning to make a four tread driving storage robot. This robot will have an automatic opening hatch to store things in. 
There will be two leds that will show where the hatch is opened or “locked/closed”. 
The robot will have eyes that will work as fog lights so that it even works in the dark. The treds will be controlled by a hand controller. 
There will be a speedometer to show how fast the robot is going in mph while being controlled.
